<h2>Industry Experience</h2>

<p>
    Currently I work on the backend connectivity architecture for medical infusion devices at Becton Dickinson.
    We are a small team dedicated to providing a low-latency, high traffic volume connection to a dedicated server.
    As the most senior dev on the connectivity team, I also take on the role of tech lead and subject-matter expert.
    What this looks like is I spend a good majority of my day supporting troubleshooting and debugging issue with my colleagues.
</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

<p>
    While I do have a large repertoire of coding knowledge in my back pocket, and I operate on a philosophy of coding
    principles is more important than memorizing the syntax of languages, I understand that most companies are interested
    in the languages with which potential software developers have industry experience.
</p>

<p>
    For me that is almost exclusively .NET Core and C#. As of writing this C# is my daily language, and thus, is the one
    I am most comfortable and confident in writing an application. Following are other languages I am familiar with in order
    of what I'd go to first for a personal project:
</p>

<ul id="language-list">
    <li>C</li>
    <li>Rust</li>
    <li>Bash</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
</ul>

<h2>Battle Station</h2>

<p>My personal daily driver is a custom-built, AMD-based tower running Arch Linux.</p>

<p>I hope to be able to one day work for a company, or even freelance some projects, where I can use my own hardware.</p>

<p>
    My biggest pet-peeve in my professional life has become that I have to choose between a Windows or macOS laptop.
    I find both to be sluggish and often come with pre-installed, un-removable software that eats up precious RAM.
    RAM I could be using to be more productive for my employer.

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I hold a B.B.A. in Business Analytics and Information Systems issued by the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa</p>
