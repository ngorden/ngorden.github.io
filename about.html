                    <h2>Industry Experience</h2>

                    <p>
                        Currently I work on the backend connectivity architecture for medical infusion devices at Becton
                        Dickinson.
                        We are a small team dedicated to providing a low-latency, high traffic volume connection to a
                        dedicated server.
                        As the most senior dev on the connectivity team, I also take on the role of tech lead and
                        subject-matter expert.
                        What this looks like is I spend a good majority of my day supporting troubleshooting and
                        debugging issue with my colleagues.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

                    <p>
                        While I do have a large repertoire of coding knowledge in my back pocket, and I operate on a
                        philosophy of coding
                        principles is more important than memorizing the syntax of languages, I understand that most
                        companies are interested
                        in the languages with which potential software developers have industry experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For me that is almost exclusively .NET Core and C#. As of writing this C# is my daily language,
                        and thus, is the one
                        I am most comfortable and confident in writing an application. Following are other languages I
                        am familiar with in order
                        of what I'd go to first for a personal project:
                    </p>

                    <ul id="language-list">
                        <li>C</li>
                        <li>Rust</li>
                        <li>Bash</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Battle Station</h2>

                    <p>My personal daily driver is a custom-built, AMD-based tower running Arch Linux.</p>

                    <p>I hope to be able to one day work for a company, or even freelance some projects, where I can use
                        my own hardware.</p>

                    <p>
                        My biggest pet-peeve in my professional life has become that I have to choose between a Windows
                        or macOS laptop.
                        I find both to be sluggish and often come with pre-installed, un-removable software that eats up
                        precious RAM.
                        RAM I could be using to be more productive for my employer.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Education</h2>

                    <p>I hold a B.B.A. in Business Analytics and Information Systems issued by the Tippie College of
                        Business at the University of Iowa</p>
