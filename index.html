                    <h3>Projects</h3>

                    <p>
                        As of late, my projects have consisted of simple api and cli tools that some may find useful.
                        They can also serve as an indicator of how the quality of my skills develop over time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Project highlights can be found <a href="projects.html">here</a>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Resume</h3>

                    <p>
                        While I feel that this webpage and the links within serve as a fine resume, I have added a link
                        to a pdf of a traditional resume.
                        I keep my public resume in a git repository, so it will always be up-to-date.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Linkedin</h3>

                    <p>
                        Linkedin is the only social media on which I am active; and only because it is, in my opinion,
                        the best way to be
                        exposed to potential employers. I won't say much more on that other than this:
                    </p>

                    <div>
                    <pre id="quote">
The thought process that went into building [social media] applications,
Facebook being the first of them … was all about:

            <em>‘How do we consume as much of your time
                and conscious attention as possible?’</em>

That means that we needed to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while
because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever … It’s a social validation
feedback loop …

            <em>You’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology …</em>

The inventors, creators — it’s me, it’s Mark [Zuckerberg], it’s Kevin Systrom on Instagram,
it’s all of these people — understood this consciously.

                        <em>And we did it anyway.</em>
